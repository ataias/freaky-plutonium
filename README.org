* freaky-plutonium
** Purpose
   Search words in multiple dictionaries, so that I can avoid Cmd + Tab all the
   time. A secondary goal is to help me creating Anki flashcards more easily by
   suggesting cards instead of me digging for all the pieces and doing a lot of
   repetitive manual work.

** Philosophy
   Reuse programs that do parts of the work as much as possible.
