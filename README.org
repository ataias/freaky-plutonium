* freaky-plutonium
** Purpose
   Search words in multiple dictionaries, so that I can avoid Cmd + Tab all the
   time. A secondary goal is to help me creating Anki flashcards more easily by
   suggesting cards instead of me digging for all the pieces and doing a lot of
   repetitive manual work.

** Philosophy
   Reuse programs that do parts of the work as much as possible.
** Scope
*** French Sources
    - Larousse
    - Reverso
    - Collins French
    - [[https://www.le-dictionnaire.com/][Le Dictionnaire]]

** Ideas
- Use lynx to download the text version of a word definition or usage examples
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Get definition for aveuglement in a text file
  # Get the data
  lynx -display_charset=UTF-8 \
       -dump "https://context.reverso.net/translation/french-english/aveuglement" \
       > aveuglement.txt
  # Now you should slice and dice the data, as well as format it, should be easy
#+END_SRC

- Parse the data, using Rust or F#
